# Semantic-Image-Segmentation-using-Contextual-Hierarchical-Models
We used the Contextual Hierarchy Models (CHM) developed by Seyedhosseini ET. Al which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for semantic segmentation. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on down-sampled input images and output of previous levels. We then incorporate the resulting multidimensional contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This training method allowed for optimization of a joint posterior probability at multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. To do this, we use CHM since they run on CPUâ€™s in less time than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) due to its stage by stage training process. We also employ a segmentation framework that takes advantage of both input image and contextual information. This information is then learned in a Supervised framework making it more discriminative compared to auto-context algorithms as done by other groups. By using the required steps in employing a CHM, we later defined the bottom-up approach where multiple classifiers are learned and then use a top-down classifier to train one classifier at a time making it beneficial due to the prior knowledge developed through the bottom-up stage. This way we us simple filtering to create context images at different levels. We then used a Maximum Aposterirori (MAP) for knowing the posterior distribution directly. We eventually trained 8 CHM in a one-vs.-all architecture as proposed previously on the Stanford Background Dataset and produced improved pixel-wise and class-average accuracy as the baseline at that time.
